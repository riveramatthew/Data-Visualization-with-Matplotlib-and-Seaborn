# Data Visualization Project

This project demonstrates the importance and value of **data visualization techniques** in the data analysis process. It is divided into two main parts:

---

## Project Overview

### Part I: Exploratory Data Visualization  
In this section, you will use Python visualization libraries to **systematically explore a dataset**.  
- Begin with plots of single variables.  
- Progress to plots involving multiple variables.  
- Identify patterns, relationships, and insights that can guide deeper analysis.  

### Part II: Explanatory Data Visualization  
Here, you will transform your exploratory plots into **polished, explanatory visualizations**.  
- Create a short presentation that highlights trends, relationships, and insights.  
- Apply design principles to communicate findings effectively to an audience.  

> ðŸ’¡ A simplified example of project deliverables can be found in *What You Will Create*. Review it before starting your project.

## Why This Project?

Data visualization is essential throughout the **data analysis lifecycle**:  

- **Exploratory visualization** helps uncover patterns, relationships, and potential issues during and after data wrangling.  
- **Explanatory visualization** conveys findings clearly and persuasively to others.  

By completing this project, you will also strengthen your ability to be a **critical consumer of visualizations** presented by others.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this project, you will be able to:  
- Supplement statistical analysis with visualizations to build understanding.  
- Choose appropriate plots, limits, transformations, and aesthetics for exploring datasets.  
- Apply design principles to create effective, audience-focused visualizations.
